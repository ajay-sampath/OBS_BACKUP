Day 1: ![🤯](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f92f/72.png) A YouTube Channel Can Change Your Life


Hey friend ![👋](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f44b/72.png)

Welcome to the Part-Time YouTuber Crash Course - a free series of 7 emails (for the next 7 days) where I’ll share my top tips and tricks for kickstarting, or growing, your YouTube channel. ![🚀](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f680/72.png)

You might’ve been dreaming of starting for years, never even considered it before this newsletter, or maybe even have videos up already - at the end of this 7-day Crash Course you’ll be much more empowered and have a clear idea of exactly why YouTube is the best, and how to do it right.

Let’s do it ![💪](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f4aa/72.png)

To begin with, if you’re not fully convinced YouTube can utterly change your life, here’s how it’s changed mine:

##  **![💰](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f4b0/72.png) 1: Money**

Let’s be honest money is a fairly important driver for many things we do. I’ve been pretty transparent about my earnings so I might as well use them to make this point. Just through YouTube and the audience I’ve built with it, I’ve now turned this hobby into a business which generated [$4.7 million last year](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/27u6m2z3qla9u6r6lvu3hr54qw44/7qh7h2u0d6g6wmc9/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj1Ub3o3WEVzU0hfbyZ0PTE2NDRz) which is absolutely mindblowingly insane.

Back in 2019 I was working around 10 hours on the channel most weeks (on evenings and weekends) and still making more money than I was earning in my full-time job as a doctor.

Now I’ve got complete financial freedom, plus a team of 13 people, and it’s all down to starting this whole YouTube thing ![🤯](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f92f/72.png)

##  **![🌎](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f30e/72.png) 2: Work Anywhere in the World**

When the world isn’t ending, you might be someone who dreams of/enjoys travelling, or you might just prefer staying home instead of braving the daily commute. Either way, all you need is a laptop and camera and you can work from anywhere at any time. It’s pretty cool.

##  **![🕊](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f54a/72.png) 3: Freedom**

Morgan Housel, author of [_The Psychology of Money_](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/27u6m2z3qla9u6r6lvu3hr54qw44/owhkhwu4x6z6g8hq/aHR0cHM6Ly9nZW5pLnVzLzVvcGMzUA==), says the value of money is that it gives you “the ability to do what you want, when you want, with who you want, for as long as you want to.”

And that’s what YouTube can give you ![✌️](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/270c_fe0f/72.png)

My team and I have all our meetings on a Monday, so then I have the rest of the week free to film videos, write my book, go to the gym and hang out with my friends pretty much as I please. You don’t have to quit your day job, but you might get to a place where you don’t have to be there either. Work becomes a choice.

##  **![❤️](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/2764_fe0f/72.png) 4: Heroes and Friendships**

It’s a lot easier to get a reply from your personal heroes when you can give them something back (exposure in a video for example). YouTube’s allowed me to connect with people I could only dream of, and at the same time it’s led to some amazing people getting in touch with me. Without YouTube, I doubt our paths would’ve ever crossed ![🤝](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f91d/72.png)

Life is really about connections and interactions, and YouTube is genuinely a brilliant way to supercharge both.

##  **![💌](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f48c/72.png) 5: Changing Lives**

One thing that never gets old is people writing in to say you’ve changed their lives. Although I do get a bit of imposter syndrome every time, there’s nothing more heartwarming than someone actually saying you’ve changed their life.

Bringing these little bits of happiness, positive change (or even humour with others making fun of you lol) is such a big plus.

##  **![💥](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f4a5/72.png) 6: Impact**

The most insane thing that’s come from this journey has been the level of impact me and my community of subscribers have had on other people’s lives.

One [video](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/27u6m2z3qla9u6r6lvu3hr54qw44/z2hgh7uo5kgkpotz/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_YWJfY2hhbm5lbD1BbGlBYmRhYWwmdXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPUFsaSUyN3MlMjBQYXJ0LVRpbWUlMjBZb3VUdWJlciUyMENyYXNoLUNvdXJzZSZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPWVtYWlsJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9UmV2dWUlMjBuZXdzbGV0dGVyJnY9UEhnZFhXWkxzOWc=) I made on the Giving What You Can Pledge made $1 million in extra pledges, saving approximately 400 lives. (It costs approx $2500 to save a human life through donations to the Against Malaria Foundation). This is way more than I ever saved when I was a doctor. (For context, the average doctor saves around 20 lives in their entire career ([source](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/27u6m2z3qla9u6r6lvu3hr54qw44/p8hehqu9r2v2gzbr/aHR0cHM6Ly84MDAwMGhvdXJzLm9yZy8yMDEyLzA5L2hvdy1tYW55LWxpdmVzLWRvZXMtYS1kb2N0b3Itc2F2ZS1wYXJ0LTMtcmVwbGFjZW1lbnQtODQvP3V0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1BbGklMjdzJTIwUGFydC1UaW1lJTIwWW91VHViZXIlMjBDcmFzaC1Db3Vyc2UmdXRtX21lZGl1bT1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fc291cmNlPVJldnVlJTIwbmV3c2xldHRlciM6fjp0ZXh0PVRoZSUyMGltcGFjdCUyMG9mJTIwbWFyZ2luYWwlMjBkb2N0b3JzLGludGVydmFsJTIwb2YlMjA2MDAlMkQ5MjAlMjBRQUxZcy4mdGV4dD0yMCUyMGxpdmVz))).

Puts things into perspective and makes you realise the crazy potential that can come from making silly videos on the internet ![😜](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f61c/72.png)

##  **![🚀](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f680/72.png) 7: It’s Really Fun**

Honestly, making YouTube videos is a blast ![😎](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f60e/72.png)

It’s scary initially, but you learn so much with each video, and when you hit _publish_ it’s like your little creation is going out into the world. Then you get the views, the likes and the comments, which are wholesome and supportive 99.9% of the time.

You find yourself improving over time, you start getting messages from friends saying they saw your video and they thought it was cool. It’s all pretty fun.
