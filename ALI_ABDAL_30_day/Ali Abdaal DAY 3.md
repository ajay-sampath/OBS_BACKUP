Day 3: ![👨‍⚕️](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f468_200d_2695_fe0f/72.png) 5 Productivity Tips for Part-Time YouTubers


Hey friend,

If you’re thinking of starting YouTube, chances are, you’re not dropping everything else from day one.

That’s probably for the best ![👍](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f44d/72.png)

Being all-in doesn’t mean you do YouTube and only YouTube. I was making **2-3 videos a week for 3 years** before I finally decided to leave my day job as a doctor.

I’m a huge fan of [side hustles](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/gku2gnodpvcwur7rgnhrh5x9dv99/l2heh6uoqv2vv2fg/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj00VjJad2dKdzYySSZ0PTExNjVz), so naturally I’m a huge fan of YouTube being a Part-Time thing.

Finding content ideas, planning out videos, filming and editing - these can seem like an endless amount of work. But it really doesn’t need to take over your life, and you can very well manage it alongside everything else. Here are 5 techniques for doing just that:

##  **![🧱](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f9f1/72.png) 1: Batching**

If you’re anything like me, your room probably isn’t always camera-ready. If you’re someone who tries to look presentable, _you_ might not always be ready either. Whether it’s getting into the headspace to film a video, making sure the background looks ok or making sure your camera settings are ok, there’s always just so much friction to getting started. And when you’re filming multiple videos in a week you can waste just so much time ‘getting ready’ to film.

![🚀](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f680/72.png) The way forward is _batching ![🚀](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f680/72.png)_ 

Pick a day. Maybe once a week or fortnight. Maybe if you’re super pro, once a month. Sit down, and film yourself doing 2, 3, maybe 5 videos at a time. It’s honestly game-changing. This way you don’t need to keep setting things up again and again every time you want to get 30 minutes of filming done. Trust me, it’s so simple but saves tonnes of time.

##  **![🥷](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f977/72.png) 2: Stealing Ideas Like An Artist**

One of the biggest things I’ve heard from people just starting out is a concern around coming up with enough ideas. A huge part of this comes from wanting to create ‘original’ content.

It’s a total myth that ideas are original. They really aren’t.

Some of the biggest artists themselves refer to their work as ‘[stealing](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/gku2gnodpvcwur7rgnhrh5x9dv99/m2h7h6uo20500ztl/aHR0cHM6Ly9nZW5pLnVzL0lBV0FiT1I_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPUFsaSUyN3MlMjBQYXJ0LVRpbWUlMjBZb3VUdWJlciUyMENyYXNoLUNvdXJzZSZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPWVtYWlsJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9UmV2dWUlMjBuZXdzbGV0dGVy)’. Of course, there are lines one can cross, but if you’re a beginner, you’re really very safe. Chances are, you won’t have the equipment, time or resources to create videos _exactly_ like the ones you see. So you’re fine. Honestly, go for anything ![🤷‍♂️](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f937_200d_2642_fe0f/72.png)

Once you let go of this idea of wanting to create something original every time (btw, if you can, go for it), you’ll find so many ideas already out there.

Create what you like to see. Make it authentic to you and you’re golden ![☀️](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/2600_fe0f/72.png)

‘Creativity’ really doesn’t have to be that difficult.

##  **![🛤](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f6e4/72.png) 3: Parallel Processing**

There are 2 types of task - _heavy lifts ![🏋️‍♀️](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f3cb_fe0f_200d_2640_fe0f/72.png)_  and _slow burns ![🔥](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f525/72.png)_ 

A heavy lift is sitting down with a blank screen (or paper) and trying to plan out a video from nothing: no title, no topic, no ideas. Unless you have endless time, this process in unlikely to be enjoyable or sustainable.

In contrast, a slow burn is much more juicy. This is where you’re able to **chip away at multiple projects at the same time**.

Let’s say you see a video that resonates with you - write this title and idea somewhere. Seen a thumbnail you can recreate? Screenshot it. You read a sentence in a book making a good argument on a subject you’re interested in - add it to your resources.

Just being proactive like this means you’ll **never need to start from a blank page**. You’ll always have multiple little half-formed or almost-fully-scripted videos waiting for you at all times. If you block some time to add finishing touches - your content will seriously never stop flowing.

Since I’ve expanded my team our workflow system has undergone a bunch of changes, so I’m sure you’ll see a video about that sometime soon. Safe to say we arrive on a Monday with no more than a couple of one-sentence video ideas, which get fleshed out throughout the week ![🏃‍♂️](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f3c3_200d_2642_fe0f/72.png)

##  **![🏛](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f3db/72.png) 4: Systematic Structuring**

So you have your idea, you have some bullet-points on what you want to say - how do you turn that into a video? This is a huge topic, but here are some structuring guides that will help:

**Listicles ![🔢](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f522/72.png)** 

This is where you just go through the points you want to make one by one (like this email). It requires minimal effort and can be super successful. I’ve used this method in a few of my [videos.](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/gku2gnodpvcwur7rgnhrh5x9dv99/dphehmuqdw6wwgbl/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj1HZzhfVEE3VTBVdw==)​

**Essay Structure ![📝](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f4dd/72.png)** 

This is what we used to do in English Literature. And there’s a reason we used it - it makes sense and sounds good. You take an intro that explains the issue. You have a body divided into sections that ideally each make a single point. You weigh options. You compare pros and cons. You summarise in the end. It’s essentially an oral essay. Here’s a pretty personal recent [example](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/gku2gnodpvcwur7rgnhrh5x9dv99/e0hph0ukmwvww3i7/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj1tWk9WTHJMWEtDRSZ0PTEwNzBz).

**Story Structures ![📖](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f4d6/72.png)** 

This is the Gold Standard. This is what I wish I could be doing with every video and what I’m aiming for. Humans have evolved around stories, we love them. So if you can turn what you say into a story that follows a hero’s journey, everything will become endlessly more attractive to the viewer. Make what you say **personal** and show how it has **transformed** you, and more people will be compelled to listen. A better example of what the hero’s journey actually means is this [video](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/gku2gnodpvcwur7rgnhrh5x9dv99/7qh7h2u0dplppra9/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dD01M3MmdXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPUFsaSUyN3MlMjBQYXJ0LVRpbWUlMjBZb3VUdWJlciUyMENyYXNoLUNvdXJzZSZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPWVtYWlsJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9UmV2dWUlMjBuZXdzbGV0dGVyJnY9SGhrNE45QTBvQ0E=). And if you want to get better at storytelling, get [Storyworthy](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/gku2gnodpvcwur7rgnhrh5x9dv99/owhkhwu4xl9llqfq/aHR0cHM6Ly9nZW5pLnVzL2pzM0F4) by Matthew Dicks, it’ll change how you think about stories and the world in general.

##  **![💻](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f4bb/72.png) 5: Efficient Editing**

Editing takes possibly the largest chunk of time. You’ll quickly realise how many ‘umms’ and ‘ahhhs’ you’re injecting after everything. Every. Other. Word.

In my book, there’s really no excuse for having poorly-edited videos. I use Final Cut Pro X, if you search you can find endless free resources to learn it online. If you want to jump straight into the YouTube editing game, I have a Skillshare Class on Video Editing with Final Cut Pro that has 39,000 students and pretty sick reviews (you can access it for free [here](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/gku2gnodpvcwur7rgnhrh5x9dv99/z2hgh7uo5r6rrmhz/aHR0cHM6Ly9nby5hbGlhYmRhYWwuY29tL3ZpZGVvZWRpdGluZyUyMD91dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249QWxpJTI3cyUyMFBhcnQtVGltZSUyMFlvdVR1YmVyJTIwQ3Jhc2gtQ291cnNlJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09ZW1haWwmdXRtX3NvdXJjZT1SZXZ1ZSUyMG5ld3NsZXR0ZXI=)) - it’ll take you from beginner to pro in under 4 hours ![🚀](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f680/72.png)

This was a long one, but if you do truly manage to implement these 5 processes in your workflow you’ll be _guaranteed_ an efficient, super-manageable and most importantly, fun Part-Time-YouTuber life.

See you tomorrow where we’ll chat about the skill of creating valuable educational content,
