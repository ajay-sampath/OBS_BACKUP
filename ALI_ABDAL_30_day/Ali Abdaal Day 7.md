Day 7: ![🤝](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f91d/72.png) My System for Effortless Consistency on YouTube'

Hey friend,

#ali_addaal   #ali_addaal_30_days_challenge

Now that you’re fully equipped to get started, we need to make sure you keep going and don’t stop ![💪](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f4aa/72.png)

Being super-pumped about something only to drop it after a short while is something you may be familiar with (I may or may not do this myself ![👀](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f440/72.png)).

In a game where consistency is everything, you don’t want to be depending on your fickle motivation to succeed. Here’s two ways you can make sure you don’t let yourself slack.

##  **![🤝](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f91d/72.png) 1 - Accountability**

One thing stronger than the desire to procrastinate may just be the embarrassment of not sticking to a promised schedule. Finding an accountability partner to hold you to account is absolutely game changing.

My top tips for a good accountability partner are:

1.  ![🧑‍🤝‍🧑](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f9d1_200d_1f91d_200d_1f9d1/72.png) Find someone you’re not too close with (if you’re already too comfortable with them, this isn’t going to work)
2.  ![🔧](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f527/72.png) Find someone who also has projects of their own they want to be held accountable for (it’s a two-way street after all)
3.  ![🤑](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f911/72.png) Put money on the line. Seriously. If I promise my flatmate I’ll give her $1000 if I don’t film a video today, chances are, I’m really going to do it (if you’re not willing to make that promise, do you really want to get the thing done?)

##  **![👨‍👩‍👧‍👦](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f468_200d_1f469_200d_1f467_200d_1f466/72.png) 2 - Community**

Working with others in the same boat is game changing.

You don’t feel mad. You don’t feel alone. You learn from other beginners’ mistakes. You get inspired by other’s work. You get all your little questions easily answered. You get to see those going through the next few steps ahead of you. You get to bounce ideas off many different people and you have a bunch of constant support from others who know exactly what you’re going through ![😇](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f607/72.png)

I can’t explain just how much of a difference this all makes.

But this is hard to find.

We’ve built a community like this in the Part Time YouTuber Academy. We’ve now taught over 3000 students whose life were changed thanks to the power of YouTube.

Either way, I genuinely hope you enjoyed these 7 days and that perhaps you learnt something new, got inspired, or just gained some insight into what happens behind the scenes of my YouTube channel.

All the best with yours,

**PS** This lesson wouldn't be complete without a Notion template ![😅](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f605/72.png) So, here's a free [**Accountability Buddy Template**](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/4zunrvx09eb7uvzvw0bxh3d7pv77/l2hvl8klu6uoqozpemfg/aHR0cHM6Ly9hbGlhYmRhYWwubm90aW9uLnNpdGUvTXktQWNjb3VudGFiaWxpdHktQnVkZHktRnJlZS1UZW1wbGF0ZS03NzFlNzljNWZjOTc0ZGMxOWYyOTRmNWJkZWY4ZTgwNQ==) for you to duplicate and use to manage a mutual growth with your new accountability pal. And just like with any other bonus content, this one is also for insiders only. ![😉](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f609/72.png)
