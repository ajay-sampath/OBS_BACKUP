Day 2: ![🙈](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f648/72.png) The 5 Biggest Myths Around Starting a YouTube Channel

#ali_addaal   #ali_addaal_30_days_challenge
Hey friend,

If you’ve considered saying the words ‘Welcome back to my Channel…’ and you haven’t actually got one, it’s likely one of the following assumptions have stopped you.

On the surface, they seem reasonable. But sadly, they’re all myths. All of them.

And if you fancy knowing why, here are a few reasons:

##  **![⌛️](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/231b_fe0f/72.png) Myth 1: It’s Too Late To Get Started**

For a fairly new platform, it feels like YouTube’s been around for a while. We’ve already seen the rise and fall of a bunch of YouTubers. Half of your favourites might be people with millions of subscribers. It’s easy to see all that, not know where the ‘upload video’ button is and think ‘_this ship’s sailed’, ‘why would someone watch me’, ‘I can’t compete’._

The feeling is valid ![✅](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/2705/72.png) The reasoning is not ![❌](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/274c/72.png)

Most of the audience are just looking for good videos regardless of who’s made it. There’s YouTubers still going from 0 to hundreds of thousands of subscribers in months (not to rely on this, but as an example that growing from zero is still a thing - just check out one of the students from my course [John Coogan](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/qduk48ve2gb8uzgze4hlhnpk9wkk/reh8h9uqk76v7rc6/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vYy9Kb2huQ29vZ2FuUGx1cy92aWRlb3M=)) ![🚀](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f680/72.png)

Loads of people tell me what they want to make videos about has already been done.

Well, yes of course. Nothing is original, and that’s to be expected.

But there’s an audience for everything and everyone, seriously. And there’s always a bigger audience on YouTube, the platform just seems to be getting larger - it’s not too late to jump in the game now.

##  **![🎥](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f3a5/72.png) Myth 2: You Need Good Gear**

Ah the gear. I like to think I pay a good amount of attention to visuals and detail on my channel. If you’ve seen my [gear page](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/qduk48ve2gb8uzgze4hlhnpk9wkk/08hwhgumnxlwx6ap/aHR0cHM6Ly9raXQuY28vYWxpYWJkYWFsP3V0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1BbGklMjdzJTIwUGFydC1UaW1lJTIwWW91VHViZXIlMjBDcmFzaC1Db3Vyc2UmdXRtX21lZGl1bT1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fc291cmNlPVJldnVlJTIwbmV3c2xldHRlcg==), it looks pretty expensive. It’s not a beginners setup. It grew as my channel did.

All you need to get started is your smartphone (not even a stand, use a box or some books to prop it up ![📚](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f4da/72.png)) and a mic off Amazon. You’ll be fine. My friend [Elizabeth](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/qduk48ve2gb8uzgze4hlhnpk9wkk/8ghqh3ugw3rp3mul/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vY2hhbm5lbC9VQ1VGRkhYdnpBTVJTRDhCcTRiSnBweFE_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPUFsaSUyN3MlMjBQYXJ0LVRpbWUlMjBZb3VUdWJlciUyMENyYXNoLUNvdXJzZSZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPWVtYWlsJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9UmV2dWUlMjBuZXdzbGV0dGVy) got to 1k subscribers in two months using just an iPhone camera, and she’s gradually upgraded her gear as she’s grown, just like I did.

In fact, if you want to get started with filming videos using just your phone, I’ve made a [video explaining exactly how to do that](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/qduk48ve2gb8uzgze4hlhnpk9wkk/vqh3hmunm4w34wcw/aHR0cHM6Ly95b3V0dS5iZS9Kd2hzUGROMlJOZz91dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249QWxpJTI3cyUyMFBhcnQtVGltZSUyMFlvdVR1YmVyJTIwQ3Jhc2gtQ291cnNlJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09ZW1haWwmdXRtX3NvdXJjZT1SZXZ1ZSUyMG5ld3NsZXR0ZXI=) ![🤙](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f919/72.png)

If you can and want to invest in gear - absolutely do it. It’s definitely a plus (more on gear later), but it’s nowhere near enough reason not to get started. Get some natural lighting, prop up your phone and press record. It’s definitely good enough.

##  **![👽](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f47d/72.png) Myth 3: You Need To Know What Your Niche Is**

_‘But I’m interested in so many things.’ ‘I don’t know what to talk about.’ ‘Who would I make videos for?_’

Honestly, you never really have your niche truly defined.

You change, they change, times change, it’s all super-fluid. And literally everyone feels the same way when they start.

We all sometimes think there’s nothing interesting about us and equally that we can’t find ‘just one thing’ to make videos about.

It’s normal.

Just pick one. The smaller your niche at the start, the better.

And then make one video. It’ll give you ideas for a second. Maybe if you’re lucky to get a question in the comments, there’s a third.

If you’re in it for the long haul, know your niche will change anyways - my channel’s certainly changed over the years. Just find something you can talk about for 3 minutes and film it.

Figure out the rest as you go ![❤️](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/2764_fe0f/72.png)

##  **![🗣](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f5e3/72.png) Myth 4: You Need To Be a Good Public Speaker**

Not going to lie, this one kind of makes me smile. Do you need to be a good public speaker? Absolutely not. If you haven’t spoken on camera before, chances are, you’ll find your on-screen self to be an awkward mess for the first few videos ![🥴](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f974/72.png)

That’s not to put you off. That’s to say it takes at least 10 videos to get used to it. And that everyone will - it’s a practised skill. When someone comes to me asking how to improve their speech on camera, I won’t really say anything until they’ve got at least 10 videos out.

Go to your favourite YouTuber’s first videos (you can filter by date) and enjoy the awkward mess that is everyone’s first few attempts at filming ![😉](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f609/72.png) The sooner you start, the sooner you get past this mandatory learning curve.

##  **![🙈](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f648/72.png) Myth 5: I’m Too Scared To Start, YouTubers Are Confident**

I used to be terrified of putting myself out there. But then, 5 years ago, I read a book called [_Show Your Work_](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/qduk48ve2gb8uzgze4hlhnpk9wkk/l2heh6uoq4xv4dfg/aHR0cHM6Ly9nZW5pLnVzL2RhNzY=) by Austin Kleon that changed my life.

It’s a book about self-promotion for people who hate the idea of self-promotion ![😳](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f633/72.png)

It helped me start my blog, and the first post I made in January 2016 was called [_How to get over the fear of starting a blog_](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/qduk48ve2gb8uzgze4hlhnpk9wkk/m2h7h6uo29409xtl/aHR0cHM6Ly9hbGlhYmRhYWwuY29tL2ZlYXItb2YtYmxvZ2dpbmcvP3V0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1BbGklMjdzJTIwUGFydC1UaW1lJTIwWW91VHViZXIlMjBDcmFzaC1Db3Vyc2UmdXRtX21lZGl1bT1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fc291cmNlPVJldnVlJTIwbmV3c2xldHRlcg==)_._ In the post, I explained my thought-processes about how scared I was to start putting myself out there, and broke down the ways I got over it.

“I have to be confident to start YouTube” is a myth because almost no one’s confident when they start. Competence breeds confidence ![🔄](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f504/72.png)

The more you practise, the better you’ll get. It just takes that first step to get started, and the first step is always the hardest.

If you’re terrified, you’re in good company. Just know that everyone else who’s starting, is just as scared and doing it anyway.

That’s all from me for now. I hope this was helpful in seeing things from a different perspective. It might be that your own irrational thoughts are your biggest barrier. And the good thing is that you can reason your way out of it right now :)

If you’re at all convinced, tomorrow we’ll get into the details of how exactly one goes about becoming a Part-Time YouTuber.

Talk to you then,
