Day 6: ![📹](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f4f9/72.png) My Ultimate Gear Cheatsheet


Hey friend,

When someone’s truly serious about YouTube, they quickly start asking me: _What camera should I buy? Do I need a ringlight? Where do you put your mic, I can never see it in your videos?_

Before I give you my Ultimate Notion page about Gear, I’ll summarise some key points here:

1.  ![🔁](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f501/72.png) Nothing is more important than **consistency** and putting out content in the first place.
2.  ![📱](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f4f1/72.png) You can just get started with your phone if you absolutely must. [Here’s a video](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/n4upnokwr3uqumwm2ot6h7qg25gg/9qhzhdug42roo8bz/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dD0zcyZ1dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249QWxpJTI3cyUyMFBhcnQtVGltZSUyMFlvdVR1YmVyJTIwQ3Jhc2gtQ291cnNlJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09ZW1haWwmdXRtX3NvdXJjZT1SZXZ1ZSUyMG5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdj1Kd2hzUGROMlJOZw==) where I explain how.
3.  ![📸](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f4f8/72.png) You should consider upgrading your gear based on how seriously you want to take YouTube.
4.  ![🎙](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f399/72.png) The most important thing is audio. **People will sit through bad video quality but no one will sit through bad audio quality** - a microphone should be your first purchase.

With all that in mind, here’s the [**Ultimate Notion page**](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/n4upnokwr3uqumwm2ot6h7qg25gg/p8h32dmqbqu9r7onnvir/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubm90aW9uLnNvL1lvdVR1YmUtR2Vhci1mb3ItRGlmZmVyZW50LUJ1ZGdldHMtY2MwZGQ5OTJlOWQxNDhkMjk5ZjQ4OTg5ZDQ5MDAzY2E=) - enjoy!

There’s a lot of stuff in it, but if anything’s unclear please feel free to leave a comment on the page and I’ll try to address it. The only homework today is to familiarise yourself with that gear page and pay particular attention to the _Level 1_ options, so you can start thinking about what your first YouTube setup might include.

Tomorrow is our final newsletter, where we’ll talk about **Accountability Systems** - in short: how to make sure that once you get started, you never stop.

Talk to you then,

Ali xx
