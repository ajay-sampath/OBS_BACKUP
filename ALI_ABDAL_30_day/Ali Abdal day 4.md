Day 4: ![👨‍🏫](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f468_200d_1f3eb/72.png) Creating Valuable Educational Content is a Skill

#ali_addaal   #ali_addaal_30_days_challenge

Hey friend,

If you’ve entertained the idea of starting a YouTube channel, you’ve probably come across the beast of _Imposter Syndrome_. The feeling of ‘why on earth would anyone listen to me?’ ![🤷‍♀️](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f937_200d_2640_fe0f/72.png)

This is a feeling that every YouTuber and content creator suffers from.

I’ve been battling it since day 1, and I continue to fight it everyday.

Why would I be qualified to make videos about study methods? I’m not the best student in the world ![🌍](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f30d/72.png)

Why would I be qualified to make videos about tech or productivity? I’m not an expert.

Why would I even make this email Crash Course about being a YouTuber? I’m still under 4M subscribers - there are people out there who are infinitely more successful on YouTube than I am. Why would anyone read what I’ve got to say?

If this is a feeling you’ve ever suffered from, hopefully you’ll find this email useful.

It’s some of the stuff I remind myself of when the _Imposter Syndrome_ beast rears its ugly head ![🐺](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f43a/72.png)

##  **![💀](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f480/72.png) 1: The Curse of Knowledge**

If you’re waiting to become an ‘expert’ (whatever that means) before you get started on YouTube, you’re approaching it all wrong.

Something which isn’t said enough is that **90% of your audience will be complete beginners**.

Even when you’re targeting professionals (trust me, I’ve tried).

And the issue with an expert teaching a beginner, is that they’re so out-of-touch and on a different level that they struggle to remember what the experience of the beginner is like. They just can’t connect well. CS Lewis called this the ‘Curse of Knowledge’.

##  **![💡](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f4a1/72.png) 2: You Don’t Need to Know a Thing to Get Started on YouTube**

By still figuring things out, by being open and on a journey, even by being a bit of a mess, you’re likely to be relatable and likeable. A good mix.

You can give tips and advice the audience can immediately take away, and you can bring them along as you improve.

Just like it’s never too late to start, when we’re talking about what we know about a subject, **it’s never too early to start ![🕰](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f570/72.png)** 

You can make a video on how you’re starting something tomorrow; on why you’re thinking of starting to learn something; on figuring out how to find something to start to learn. Literally anything goes.

##  **![🤝](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f91d/72.png) 3: Guide Not Guru**

Another thing I keep in mind is that no matter what I ‘teach’ or explain - I put myself in the position of a **Guide** rather than that of a **Guru ![🚶‍♂️](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f6b6_200d_2642_fe0f/72.png)** 

I never paint myself as someone who’s figured it all out and is spreading his wisdom (the Guru). I’m just some guy with a camera who’s trying something out to see if it works and sharing his journey with others (Guide). If you’re the latter, it’s hard to go wrong.

And as a last point, Guru credentials really don’t matter. No one cares how many diplomas you have, they just want useful content.

I know I’ve played the Cambridge card to death but I’m still no expert - I wasn’t the best candidate who ever interviewed there, even though I was making videos about it. I certainly wasn’t anywhere near the best student there, even though I was making videos about how to study.

But people still enjoyed learning from me, as I was figuring stuff out.

Talk about what you’re figuring out, and you’ll be fine.

##  **![😳](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f633/72.png) 4: You’re Supposed to Feel Uncomfortable**

So when it comes to imposter syndrome, it may feel as though you don’t yet have the credentials to talk about what you wanna talk about.

You think that maybe in a few months, if you just read a few more books or spent a few more weeks thinking about your video ideas, you’d feel like less of an imposter in front of that camera.

But I’ve got some bad news ![👎](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f44e/72.png)

That feeling will always be lurking, and our only option is to push through it ![💪](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f4aa/72.png)

​[I spoke with Steven Bartlett on his no.1 podcast _The Diary of a CEO_ last year](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/92uqozg8lxbdu0k043t9h0x3p633/reh8h9uqke0ow2s6/aHR0cHM6Ly9vcGVuLnNwb3RpZnkuY29tL2VwaXNvZGUvMDdlS2FvQWd1VjR3c1FTelRNQXJueT9zaT16MExwUlhheVJOUzZtekpHT3hMdkV3), and after the interview, he gave me an absolutely life changing piece of advice about imposter syndrome.

We’ll probably spend most of our lives feeling like we’re ‘not supposed to be’ in a certain place, or that we don’t deserve it, and yet we achieve everything we ever have despite those feelings.

What it boils down to is that we grow exponentially when we’re uncomfortable.
