![[unnamed.png]]


## **Quote:**

**"****_Show me your calendar and I will tell you your priorities_****.****_"_** _-_ Kevin Kelly

## **Recap:**

Yesterday, we used the Ideal Ordinary Week Exercise to get a clear picture of how we want to spend our time.

## **Lesson:**

Today, you’re going to see how you _actually_ spend your time.

But first, a couple of questions.

**Question #1: What’s more valuable, time or money?**

Most people would say time.

**Question #2: Would you ever throw away money?**

Of course not.

So, why does the idea of throwing away money seem insane, yet we carelessly throw away time—our most precious resource—every day?

The answer: Awareness (or lack there of)

1. Awareness of _where our time is going_, and
2. Awareness of _how little of it we have left_ (sorry, but it’s true).

For most of us, there's a huge discrepancy between how we think we spend our time and how we _actually_ spend it. We claim to have certain priorities, but our calendars tell a different story.

The result is a life lived on “autopilot”. Forever at the mercy of distractions or other people's priorities. Oblivious to the fact that we’re losing the one thing we can never get back—our time.

Most people wait far too long to gain awareness. The death of a friend or some traumatic health scare forces them to suddenly realise the value of time. And how it can be taken from them in an instant.

The good news is that you’re here now, reading this. You’ve made a commitment to change the way you spend your time for the better.

But, before making a change, you must first become aware of where it’s actually going.

## **Method:**

Time tracking is a simple yet effective tool for gaining insight into how you spend your days. While the concept is straightforward, there are several approaches you can take, each with its own benefits. Let’s explore these in more detail:

### **Digital vs. Physical  
​**

 **![💻](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f4bb/72.png) Digital:**

- **Apps like** [**Rize**](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/8kuozq9kwpioh0zlke5fkhzp9r599/l2heh6u3l40rwecg/aHR0cHM6Ly9yaXplLmlvL2FsaWFiZGFhbA==) **or Toggl:** These digital tools offer convenience and efficiency. With just a few taps, you can start and stop timers, categorise your activities, and even receive insights and reports on your time usage.
- **Integration:** Many of these apps integrate with other digital tools and devices, providing a seamless tracking experience.
- **Data Visualisation:** They often come with features that visualise your time in graphs and charts, making it easier to identify patterns and areas for improvement

 **![📒](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f4d2/72.png) Physical:**

- **Notebook or Bullet Journal:** For those who prefer a tactile approach, tracking time in a physical journal can be very effective. It allows for customisation and can be a more mindful process.
- **Visual Creativity:** You can create colour-coded systems or symbols to represent different activities, making the process more engaging.
- **Physical Record:** There's something about having a physical record of your time that can be very satisfying and grounding.

### **Real-time tracking vs. End of day review  
​**

 **![⏳](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/23f3/72.png) Real-time tracking:**

- **Accuracy:** This method involves recording your activities as they happen. It's likely the most accurate way to track time since it captures your day as it unfolds.
- **Immediate Feedback:** Real-time tracking can provide instant insights into how you're spending your time, allowing for quicker adjustments.

 **![✍️](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/270d_fe0f/72.png) End of day review:**

- **Convenience:** Sitting down at the end of your day to review and record your activities might be more practical for some, especially if you find real-time tracking disruptive.
- **Reflective:** This method also allows for reflection on your day, but it relies heavily on memory and may be less precise.

### **Some hard and fast rules for time tracking:**

1. **Be honest**  
    It’s crucial that you don’t lie about how you’re spending time. Also, don’t make any drastic changes to your routine on the day you track.
2. **Be meticulous**  
    Do your best to account for every minute. You may not think much of those 5-minute phone breaks, but they add up quickly.
3. **Make it easy**  
    Choose the method that’s easiest for you. The last thing you want is for this to become another activity you’re wasting time on.

Remember, the purpose of time tracking is to understand where your time goes, identify any inefficiencies, and make informed decisions about how to use your time more effectively. Whether you opt for digital tools, a physical journal, real-time tracking, or end-of-day reviews, the key is consistency and honesty in your approach.

You don’t have to do this every day for the rest of your life. Even 1 or 2 days will give you a solid baseline of awareness to work with.

But, it’s a good idea to make a habit of doing it once per month/quarter. Especially if you feel like something is “off” in your life, as this can be a warning sign that your attention is being pulled to the wrong places and needs adjusting.

## **Action Step:**

Track your time for the next few days, either in real-time or summarised at the end of the day. The more days you do it, the better idea you’ll get of where your time is going.

Tomorrow we’ll check in on your progress for Week 1, and **we have a small gift for you.**

See you then.
