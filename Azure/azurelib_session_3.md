How can we access a Storage account ?
1) Access key
2) SAS TOKEN


Access key have a problem
that is it gives someone a full control 
so azure does  not recommend to use access key (generally we try to give the lowest possible permission)

Access key will have two types
key 1
and key 2


file grade access


access keys give entiere permission 

where as sas tokens will have limied permission, which we have granted at token level
