**To retrieve data from a MySQL database using input from users and leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs)** 

Steps (according to Chat)

1. **Obtain OpenAI API Access**: Sign up for an API key from OpenAI.
    
2. **Develop a Middleware Application**: Create an application that will serve as an intermediary between the user, the OpenAI API, and your SQL database.
    
3. **User Interface for Query Input**: Implement a user interface where users can input their queries in natural language.
    
4. **Send User Queries to OpenAI API**: Configure the middleware to send these natural language queries to the OpenAI API.
    
5. **Process OpenAI API Responses**: Interpret the API's response to extract or construct an SQL query.
    
6. **Translate to SQL Queries**: Ensure the middleware can translate the interpreted response into a valid SQL query.
    
7. **Execute SQL Queries on Database**: Safely execute the generated SQL query on your SQL database.
    
8. **Format and Return Results**: Format the query results from the database into a user-friendly format and present them to the user.
    
9. **Implement Security Measures**: Ensure the entire process is secure, protecting both the data and the system from unauthorized access or injection attacks.
    
10. **Feedback and Iteration**: Establish a feedback mechanism for users to report issues or inaccuracies, using this input to iteratively improve the system.
