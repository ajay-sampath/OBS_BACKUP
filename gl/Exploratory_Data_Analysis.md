### Descriptive Statistics

Descriptive statistics provide a way to summarize and describe the features of a dataset. They offer a quick overview and give you a sense of the data’s general patterns. Here are the key components:


#### Measures of Central Tendency

- **Mean**: The average of all data points. Calculated by adding up all the values and dividing by the number of values.
- **Median**: The middle value in the data when it is arranged in ascending order. If there’s an even number of observations, it's the average of the two middle numbers.
- **Mode**: The most frequently occurring value in the data set. There can be more than one mode.

#### 2. Measures of Dispersion (Spread)

- **Range**: The difference between the highest and the lowest values.
- **Variance**: Measures how far each number in the set is from the mean and thus from every other number in the set.
- **Standard Deviation (SD)**: The square root of the variance, providing a measure of the average distance from the mean. A low SD indicates that the data points tend to be close to the mean.

#### 3. Shape of the Distribution

- **Skewness**: A measure of the asymmetry of the probability distribution. Positive skew means the tail is on the right, negative skew means it's on the left.
- **Kurtosis**: A measure of whether the data are heavy-tailed or light-tailed relative to a normal distribution. High kurtosis means more outliers.

#### 4. Additional Descriptive Measures

- **Quartiles**: Divide the data into four equal parts. The median is the second quartile.
- **Interquartile Range (IQR)**: Difference between the third quartile (Q3) and the first quartile (Q1), showing the spread of the middle half of the dataset.
- **Percentiles**: Indicate the relative standing of a value in a dataset. For instance, the 90th percentile is the value below which 90% of the data falls.

#### 5. Visual Representations

- **Histograms**: Show the distribution of a dataset and identify patterns, such as normal distribution or skewness.
- **Box plots**: Useful for displaying the range, median, quartiles, and identifying outliers.
