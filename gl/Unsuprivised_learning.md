What is Unsupervised learning? 
•Dimensionality reduction and clustering. 
•Clustering algorithms.
•Hierarchical and K means clustering.
•Hierarchical clustering-agglomerative and divisive clustering.
•Agglomerative Clustering –Working of the basic algorithms.
•Distance matrix -Interpreting dendrograms. 
•Choosing the threshold to determine the optimum number of clusters.
