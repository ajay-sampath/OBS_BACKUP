### What is a p-value?

- **Definition**: The p-value is the probability of obtaining test results at least as extreme as the results actually observed, under the assumption that the null hypothesis (H₀) is true.
- **Interpretation**: It's a measure of the strength of the evidence against the null hypothesis. A smaller p-value indicates stronger evidence against H₀, suggesting that the observed data is unlikely to have occurred by random chance alone.

### How is it Used?

- **Hypothesis Testing**: In the context of hypothesis testing, the p-value helps determine whether to reject the null hypothesis.
- **Significance Level (α)**: The p-value is compared to a predetermined significance level, α, which is often set at 0.05 (5%). If the p-value is less than or equal to α, the null hypothesis is rejected in favor of the alternative hypothesis.
- **Decision Rule**:
    - If p-value ≤ α: Reject H₀ (the result is statistically significant).
    - If p-value > α: Fail to reject H₀ (the result is not statistically significant).

### Key Points

- **Not the Probability of the Hypothesis**: The p-value does not indicate the probability that the null hypothesis is true or false. Rather, it's about the data assuming the null hypothesis is true.
- **Context Dependent**: A p-value needs to be interpreted in the context of the study and its methodology. A significant result (low p-value) does not necessarily imply a practically significant result.
- **Type I and Type II Errors**: A very low p-value (e.g., much lower than 0.05) reduces the risk of a Type I error (falsely rejecting a true null hypothesis) but doesn't eliminate the possibility of a Type II error (failing to reject a false null hypothesis).
- **Not a Measure of Effect Size**: The p-value indicates whether an effect exists but does not convey the size of the effect. Hence, it's important to consider the effect size and practical significance of the results.

In summary, the p-value is a tool for making decisions in hypothesis testing, offering a way to quantify the evidence against the null hypothesis. It's crucial to interpret it correctly and in conjunction with other statistical measures and study context.
